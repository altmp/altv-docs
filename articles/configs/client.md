# The client configuration

After you downloaded and installed the alt:V Multiplayer client, you can find the `altv.toml` file in the installation folder. This file contains the settings of the client. Per default this file only contains the branch and the path to your GTA:V installation. After the first launch of alt:V there are more settings available in the `altv.toml`. However, there are more settings that you can apply. Most of these settings can also be applied in the main menu under `Settings` but some of them need to be set up directly in this file.
