# Resources

Resources are one of the main parts of the alt:V server. They handle the data and gamescripts for server- and clientside used by the alt:V server.<br>
Resources a represented as a subfolder of the `resources/` folder in the alt:V server root.

# resource.toml

A resource (folder) is required to contain at minimum a `resource.toml` configuration file. Depending on which resource type you are using, the properties you specify in the config file may differ between each other.<br>
A resource has a folder structure like this:

> [!div class="nohljsln"]
>```
> resources/
>   [RESOURCE_NAME]/
>     resource.toml
>```

Keep in mind that this is only the minimum requirement for a resource to work. Each type has custom specifications.
