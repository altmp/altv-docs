> ```

> ```

> [!div class="nohljsln"]
> ```yaml
> - Utils.inspect (ported util.inspect from NodeJS with small differences)
> - functions & classes in Utils (e.g. drawText3d, loadMapArea, Timeout class, etc.)
> - log, logDebug, logError, logWarning now use alt.Utils.inspect
> - player.spawn(model, pos) overload
> ```

### Fixed
> [!div class="nohljsln"]

> - HandlingData.handlingNameHash returned wrong hash
> ```

### <span style="color: red;">Breaking changes</span>

> [!div class="nohljsln"]

## C# Server Module

### <span style="color: red;">Breaking changes</span>

> [!div class="nohljsln"]
> ```yaml
> - IPlayer DiscordId changed type from string to long
> - IConnectionInfo DiscordUserId changed type from string to long
> - By AsyncResource constructor the default of "forceAsyncBaseObjects" is set to "true". To go back to old behavior you need to set "false"
> - Refs were removed (Ref classes, .TryCreateRef etc)
> - ToAsync now returns null when providing async context
> ```

### Changed

> [!div class="nohljsln"]
> ```yaml
> - Async events do not force entities to exist anymore (previously it was guaranteed that if entity exists at async event start, it will exist until async event finishes)
> - ToAsync does not force entity to exist anymore. If base entity will be destroyed, async entity will fallback to cached value (or default for specific type, if caching is disabled)
> ```

### Added
> [!div class="nohljsln"]
> ```yaml
> - After entity is destroyed getters return last available information instead of throwing exception or returning default. This behavior can be reverted by setting "Alt.CacheEntities" to "false"
> - Added ability to configure behavior of handling setter/getter call on non existent entity via "Alt.ThrowIfEntityDoesNotExist". Default value is "false"
> ```

## C# Client Module

### Fixed
> [!div class="nohljsln"]
> ```yaml
> - Func<bool> returned invalid result when invoked if sandboxing is enabled
> - (server) Alt.GetPedModelInfo()
> ```

### Added
> [!div class="nohljsln"]
> ```yaml
> - AltAsync.WaitFor allows to wait asynchronously for some result. After awaiting the function automatically returns you to main thread
> ```
