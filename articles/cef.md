# CEF - Chromium Embedded Framework

The Chromium Embedded Framework (also known as CEF) is a web browser engine used in alt:V to render clientside webpages and assets - like in your everyday web browser. CEF will use your system locale.

## Debug Mode

To enable the debug mode/server on clientside for CEF, you have to enable the `debug = true` setting in your [clientside configuration](~/articles/configs/client.md).

Then, the debug server is available under `localhost:9222` (in Chromium or older Chrome) or `chrome://inspect` (in newer Chrome).
