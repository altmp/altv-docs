# Branches

In alt:V there are multiple development branches, which represent different development states of the alt:V client and server. The server and the client needs to be on the same branch to be able to connect. For normal users the release branch is recommended.

# How to change the Branch?

Changing the branch is easy, for the client you need to open the altv.toml and change the branch to the value you want to use (release, rc, dev). For the server you need to download the new files for the branch you want again from the alt:V Website or using [altv-pkg](https://github.com/altmp/altv-pkg).
