# Custom Launcher

You may want to brand your server experience from starting the game to playing on the server, if you want to make a own custom launcher and it's required to join your server, you need to open source it and the server isn't allowed to be listed on masterlist. As an alternative to creating your own launcher, it is possible to customize the official launcher. In this article you will be able to get information, how to get the official custom launcher, what you can modify and how you can modify it.
