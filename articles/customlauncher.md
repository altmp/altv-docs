# Introduction

> [!CAUTION]
> Custom launchers that are required to connect to the server are only allowed if they are fully open source and the server is not listed on the masterlist.

As an alternative to the custom launcher, it is possible to obtain a branded launcher.

The branded launcher is available from the Patreon "Diamond" tier or higher and features several server-specific displays such as an RSS feed, launcher and UI background, logo, primary color, and server name.\
In order for a user to activate this branding, a "Apply server skin" checkbox is shown when connecting to the server, which is enabled by default.

This article explains what information is required and how to request it.

# Samples
