# Add Client Mods
Client Mods won't work by default, only some verified mods will work. This is because some graphic mods change the behavior of the game or need additional scripts that aren't supported by alt:V. Only graphic mods will be supported, skins for cloths or vehicles won't be supported, because this needs to be added by the server owner. If you are a graphic mod creator and want to verify your mod for alt:V, you can contact a member of public relations.
